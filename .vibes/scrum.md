# Live-Crew Development Scrum Board

Progress tracking for implementing the live-crew orchestration service.

## üéØ VERTICAL SLICES - User Value Focused Development

**Strategic Pivot**: Restructured from 13 horizontal milestones to 3 vertical slices based on expert agent recommendations. Each slice delivers complete end-to-end user value rather than building disconnected layers.

### Slice 1: "Hello World" Event Processing üöÄ
**Target Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **User Value**: "I can send an event and see it processed into an action"

**Core Flow**: `File Input ‚Üí Memory Scheduler ‚Üí Console Output`

#### Essential Components
- [ ] **Interface Layer**: Transport, Context, Scheduler protocols (architecture-first approach)
- [ ] **CrewDefinition & Registry**: Basic crew model and registration system
- [ ] **Memory Scheduler**: Single-threaded, in-memory event processing with time slicing
- [ ] **File Event Transport**: Read events from JSON file or stdin
- [ ] **Console Action Transport**: Print actions to console/file output
- [ ] **Dict Context Backend**: Simple in-memory context (no diff-merge yet)
- [ ] **Single Crew Support**: One hardcoded crew for proof-of-concept
- [ ] **Integration Demo**: Working end-to-end example with current Event/Action models

**Foundation Ready**: ‚úÖ Event/Action models, time slicing, config, dependencies (85% complete per architecture review)

#### Success Criteria
```python
# This working example defines "done" for Slice 1:
events = load_events_from_file("events.json")
scheduler = MemoryScheduler(slice_ms=500)
crew = SimpleCrew("hello_world")

for event in events:
    actions = scheduler.process(event, crew)
    for action in actions:
        print(f"Action: {action.kind} - {action.payload}")
```

### Slice 2: "Multi-Crew Orchestration" ‚ö°
**Target Duration**: 3-4 weeks | **User Value**: "I can run multiple crews with dependencies and shared context"

**Core Flow**: `NATS Events ‚Üí Dependency Resolution ‚Üí Multi-Crew ‚Üí NATS Actions`

#### Essential Components
- [ ] **NATS Transport**: Real event/action streams using JetStream
- [ ] **Distributed Scheduler**: NATS-based scheduling with time slice coordination
- [ ] **Context Diff-Merge**: JetStream KV backend with last-writer-wins merge logic
- [ ] **Dependency Resolution**: CrewDep/EventDep orchestration with offset calculations
- [ ] **Multi-Crew Support**: 2-3 crews with dependency chains
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Basic error sink and crew isolation
- [ ] **Context Proxy**: Shared state management between crews

**Interface Reuse**: Same Transport/Context/Scheduler interfaces, different implementations

---

### Slice 3: "Production-Ready Platform" üè≠
**Target Duration**: 4-5 weeks | **User Value**: "I can deploy this in production with monitoring and reliability"

**Core Flow**: Full platform with operational features

#### Essential Components
- [ ] **Process Isolation**: Sub-process runners with crew sandboxing
- [ ] **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus metrics + structured JSON logging
- [ ] **Reliability Features**: Heartbeat system + deterministic replay capabilities
- [ ] **Operations Tooling**: CLI commands + Docker Compose deployment
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Vector search integration and performance tuning
- [ ] **Security Hardening**: Input validation, context limits, ACL implementation

**Architectural Approach**: Monitoring/reliability as decorators around existing interfaces

---

## üì¶ DEFERRED FEATURES (Post-MVP)

These become **optional enhancements** after core vertical slices:
- **Alternative Context Backends** (Redis/memory switching)
- **Multiple Vector Store Adapters** (Milvus, Pinecone beyond Qdrant)
- **Advanced Security Features** (beyond basic hardening)
- **Vector Clip Finder** (specialized search adapter)

## üìã ARCHIVED: Original Horizontal Milestones

<details>
<summary>Click to view original 13-milestone roadmap (for reference)</summary>

**Note**: These milestones are preserved for reference but replaced by vertical slice approach for better user value delivery.

**Original Milestone Progress**:
- Milestone 1: 2/5 complete (Event/Action models, TimeSlice utilities)
- Milestone 2: 1/5 complete (Dependency resolution system)
- Milestones 3-13: Various infrastructure and advanced features

**Key Insight**: Horizontal approach would delay user value until late in development. Vertical slices deliver working software every 2-4 weeks.

## Completed Sprints

### Sprint 1 - Foundation Setup & Core Models ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Duration**: Initial development phase
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All goals achieved, expert review passed

#### Sprint 1 Goals
Foundation setup with core data models and development tooling to enable future development.

#### Final Status
- ‚úÖ All 88 tests passing, 1 skipped
- ‚úÖ All ruff checks passing
- ‚úÖ All pre-commit hooks configured and working

## Current Sprint: Sprint 2 - Slice 1 Implementation

### Sprint 2: "Hello World" Event Processing (Vertical Slice 1)

**Status**: ‚úÖ READY TO START - Foundation complete, vertical slice approach validated by expert agents

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Goal**: Working end-to-end event processing demo

#### Sprint 2 Plan (Based on Architecture-Reviewer Recommendations)

**Phase 1: Interface Definition** (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Create `interfaces.py` with Transport/Context/Scheduler protocols
- [ ] Add `CrewDefinition` and `CrewRegistry` to `crew.py`
- [ ] Extend `LiveCrewConfig` with slice-specific settings
- [ ] Write behavioral tests for interfaces

**Phase 2: Slice 1 Implementation** (Days 3-5)
- [ ] `MemoryScheduler` implementing scheduler interface
- [ ] `FileEventTransport` and `ConsoleActionTransport`
- [ ] `DictContextBackend` for simple context
- [ ] Integration test: file ‚Üí processing ‚Üí console output

**Key Architectural Decisions Made:**
- ‚úÖ Interface-first approach prevents technical debt
- ‚úÖ Existing Event/Action models work unchanged across all slices
- ‚úÖ Foundation completeness: 85% ready for Slice 1 (per architecture review)
- ‚úÖ No throwaway code - interfaces designed for Slice 2 progression

**Success Criteria:**
Working demo where user can input events via file and see processed actions in console.

## Notes
- Each milestone maps to the roadmap defined in `references/live_crew_spec.md`
- Tasks should be broken down into specific, actionable items during sprint planning
- Progress should be updated regularly to maintain visibility
