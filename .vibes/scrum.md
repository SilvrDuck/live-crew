# Live-Crew Development Scrum Board

Progress tracking for implementing the live-crew orchestration service.

## üéØ VERTICAL SLICES - User Value Focused Development

**Strategic Pivot**: Restructured from 13 horizontal milestones to 3 vertical slices based on expert agent recommendations. Each slice delivers complete end-to-end user value rather than building disconnected layers.

### Slice 1: "Hello World" Event Processing üöÄ

**Target Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **User Value**: "I can send an event and see it processed into an action"

**Core Flow**: `File Input ‚Üí Memory Scheduler ‚Üí Console Output`

#### Essential Components

- [ ] **Interface Layer**: Transport, Context, Scheduler protocols (architecture-first approach)
- [ ] **CrewDefinition & Registry**: Basic crew model and registration system
- [ ] **Memory Scheduler**: Single-threaded, in-memory event processing with time slicing
- [ ] **File Event Transport**: Read events from JSON file or stdin
- [ ] **Console Action Transport**: Print actions to console/file output
- [ ] **Dict Context Backend**: Simple in-memory context (no diff-merge yet)
- [ ] **Single Crew Support**: One hardcoded crew for proof-of-concept
- [ ] **Integration Demo**: Working end-to-end example with current Event/Action models

**Foundation Ready**: ‚úÖ Event/Action models, time slicing, config, dependencies (85% complete per architecture review)

#### Success Criteria

```python
# This working example defines "done" for Slice 1:
events = load_events_from_file("events.json")
scheduler = MemoryScheduler(slice_ms=500)
crew = SimpleCrew("hello_world")

for event in events:
    actions = scheduler.process(event, crew)
    for action in actions:
        print(f"Action: {action.kind} - {action.payload}")
```

### Slice 2: "Multi-Crew Orchestration" ‚ö°

**Target Duration**: 3-4 weeks | **User Value**: "I can run multiple crews with dependencies and shared context"

**Core Flow**: `NATS Events ‚Üí Dependency Resolution ‚Üí Multi-Crew ‚Üí NATS Actions`

#### Essential Components

- [ ] **NATS Transport**: Real event/action streams using JetStream
- [ ] **Distributed Scheduler**: NATS-based scheduling with time slice coordination
- [ ] **Context Diff-Merge**: JetStream KV backend with last-writer-wins merge logic
- [ ] **Dependency Resolution**: CrewDep/EventDep orchestration with offset calculations
- [ ] **Multi-Crew Support**: 2-3 crews with dependency chains
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Basic error sink and crew isolation

## üìã ARCHIVED: Original Horizontal Milestones

<details>
<summary>Click to view original 13-milestone roadmap (for reference)</summary>

**Note**: These milestones are preserved for reference but replaced by vertical slice approach for better user value delivery.

**Original Milestone Progress**:

- Milestone 1: 2/5 complete (Event/Action models, TimeSlice utilities)
- Milestone 2: 1/5 complete (Dependency resolution system)
- Milestones 3-13: Various infrastructure and advanced features

**Key Insight**: Horizontal approach would delay user value until late in development. Vertical slices deliver working software every 2-4 weeks.

#### Sprint 2 UX Polish Phase üé® [NEW - Critical for Launch]

**Target**: Transform 59-line Hello World into 15-line developer-friendly API

**UX Issues Identified by Framework Designer:**

- **Import Hell**: Deep nested imports requiring framework internals knowledge
- **Manual Component Assembly**: Users must wire 5+ components manually
- **Verbose Handler Creation**: Too much boilerplate for simple handlers
- **Missing High-Level API**: No unified entry point for common use cases

**Phase 1: Core UX Improvements (Week 1)** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- [x] **Orchestrator API**: Create unified facade over protocol-based architecture

  - ‚úÖ Facade pattern preserves existing protocols while providing simple defaults
  - ‚úÖ `Orchestrator.from_file()`, `Orchestrator.from_config()` entry points
  - ‚úÖ Sensible defaults: FileEventTransport + ConsoleActionTransport + DictContextBackend
- [x] **Import Simplification**: Clean top-level exports in `__init__.py`

  - ‚úÖ `from live_crew import Orchestrator, event_handler, Event, Action`
  - ‚úÖ Hide internal module structure (`live_crew.backends.context`, etc.)
- [x] **Decorator Patterns**: Simple handler registration

  - ‚úÖ `@event_handler` decorator for minimal boilerplate
  - ‚úÖ Auto-registration with orchestrator instance
- [x] **Hello World Transformation**: Reduce from 59 lines to ~15 lines

  - ‚úÖ Created `minimal_example.py` with 18 lines (under 20-line target)
- [x] **Strategy Pattern Refactor**: Eliminate architectural code smells

  - ‚úÖ Replaced hasattr() duck typing with proper ResultCollector protocol
  - ‚úÖ Clean interface contracts for result collection strategies
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive Orchestrator API validation

  - ‚úÖ 11 integration tests covering basic usage, advanced features, simplified API, error handling

**Phase 2: Configuration Enhancement (Week 2)**

- [ ] **Builder Pattern**: Configuration-driven component assembly

  - `OrchestratorBuilder` for advanced customization scenarios
  - Maintain protocol injection points for advanced users
- [ ] **YAML Configuration**: Enhanced schema for orchestrator setup

  - Crew definitions in config vs code
  - Input/output/backend configuration options
- [ ] **Helper Methods**: Common Action creation patterns

  - `Action.from_event()`, `Action.create()` convenience methods

**Architectural Validation (Architect Review):**

- ‚úÖ **Protocol Integrity**: Facade pattern preserves clean protocol-based architecture
- ‚úÖ **Extensibility**: Advanced users retain full protocol access for customization
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Existing 88 tests validate protocol behavior, facade adds minimal risk
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Facade pattern adds negligible overhead over direct protocol usage

**Success Criteria - UX Transformation:**

```python
# BEFORE: 59-line Hello World (current examples/hello_world/run_example.py)
event_transport = FileEventTransport(events_file)
action_transport = ConsoleActionTransport()
context_backend = DictContextBackend()
crew_registry = SimpleCrewRegistry()
scheduler = MemoryScheduler(config, event_transport, action_transport, context_backend, crew_registry)
# ... 50+ more lines

# AFTER: 15-line Hello World (target)
from live_crew import Orchestrator, event_handler

@event_handler("user_signup")
def greet_user(event):
    return {"kind": "greeting", "payload": f"Welcome {event.payload['name']}!"}

orchestrator = Orchestrator.from_file("events.json")
orchestrator.register_handler(greet_user)
await orchestrator.run()
```

**Final Success Criteria - Phase 1:** ‚úÖ **ALL ACHIEVED**

- ‚úÖ Working end-to-end processing (ACHIEVED)
- ‚úÖ Hello World reduced to <20 lines (ACHIEVED - 18 lines)
- ‚úÖ Single import for common usage (ACHIEVED - `from live_crew import Orchestrator, event_handler`)
- ‚úÖ Protocol-based architecture preserved (ACHIEVED - facade pattern maintains extensibility)
- ‚úÖ Architectural code smells eliminated (ACHIEVED - Strategy pattern replaces duck typing)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage (ACHIEVED - 11 integration tests, 137 core tests passing)

**User Value Delivered**: "I can write standard CrewAI crews (both YAML and Python approaches) and orchestrate them through live-crew with minimal integration code"

**Success Transformation**:
- **Before**: Custom @event_handler decorators requiring framework-specific knowledge
- **After**: Standard CrewAI crews (both YAML-based and Python-defined) orchestrated through live-crew's event-driven architecture

**Vision Alignment**: Transform live-crew into the **thin wrapper** described in spec - users leverage existing CrewAI knowledge instead of learning a new framework

**Core Technical Flow**:
```
CrewAI Integration Layer (both YAML & Python approaches)
    ‚Üì
Event-Driven Execution ‚Üí Standard CrewAI Output ‚Üí live-crew Actions
    ‚Üì
CrewAI-native Context Integration & Orchestration

- **Week 2-3 Gate**: Multi-crew CrewAI orchestration working with YAML configuration
- **Sprint Complete**: YAML-driven CrewAI wrapper complete, <10 line Hello World achieved

### üèóÔ∏è Implementation Strategy

#### **Week 1: CrewAI Integration Foundation** (40% effort)
**Focus**: Establish CrewAI crew loading and execution foundation

**Team Input**:
- **UX Designer**: "SIGNIFICANT MISALIGNMENT - current approach is Python-centric, vision requires YAML-driven CrewAI integration"
- **Architect**: "Zero CrewAI integration exists despite being Sprint 3 - critical foundation gap"

**Key Tasks**:
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Research and document CrewAI integration patterns in `.vibes/references/crewai.md`
- [ ] **CrewAI Integration Adapter**: Build universal system supporting both YAML-based and Python-defined CrewAI crews
- [ ] **Dual Event-to-Task Mapping**: Support both YAML configuration and Python API for mapping events to CrewAI tasks
- [ ] **CrewAI Output Adapter**: Universal converter for CrewAI crew outputs to live-crew Actions (works with both approaches)
- [ ] **Context Bridge**: Integrate live-crew context with standard CrewAI memory and context patterns

**Week 1 Success Criteria**:
- Both YAML-based and Python-defined CrewAI crews can be loaded and executed within live-crew
- Both configuration approaches (YAML config files and Python API) working
- CrewAI output properly converted to live-crew Actions for both approaches
- Foundation tests for CrewAI integration covering both patterns (50+ new tests)

#### **Week 2-3: Multi-CrewAI Orchestration & Dual Configuration Approach** (40% effort)
**Focus**: Enable multiple standard CrewAI crews to run concurrently through both YAML configuration and Python API

**Team Input**:
- **UX Team**: "Support both approaches - YAML for configuration-heavy scenarios, Python for programmatic control"
- **Architecture Team**: "CrewAI crews should remain standard and portable regardless of integration approach"

**Key Tasks**:
- [ ] **Multi-Crew Configuration**: Implement both `<crew>.runtime.yaml` and Python API patterns for crew orchestration
- [ ] **Dependency Resolution**: CrewDep/EventDep orchestration for CrewAI crews (both approaches)
- [ ] **Concurrent CrewAI Execution**: Run multiple CrewAI crews (mixed YAML/Python) with proper coordination
- [ ] **Shared Context Integration**: Enable CrewAI crews to access and modify shared context regardless of definition approach
- [ ] **Event Distribution**: Route events to appropriate CrewAI crews based on triggers (YAML config or Python registration)
- [ ] **CrewAI-to-Action Pipeline**: Ensure all CrewAI outputs properly convert to Actions (universal converter)

**Dual Configuration Patterns**:

**Approach 1: YAML-Driven Configuration**:
```yaml
# commentary.runtime.yaml - Standard CrewAI crew with live-crew orchestration
crew: "commentary"
triggers: ["goal_scored", "penalty_awarded"]
needs:
  - type: crew
    crew: "vision_analysis"
    offset: -1
wait_policy: any
timeout_ms: 100

# Standard CrewAI files remain untouched:
# agents.yaml, tasks.yaml, crew.yaml - pure CrewAI
```

**Approach 2: Python Programmatic Configuration**:
```python
# Python-defined CrewAI crews with live-crew orchestration
from live_crew import CrewOrchestrator
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

orchestrator = CrewOrchestrator()

# Standard CrewAI crew definition
commentary_crew = Crew(agents=[...], tasks=[...])

# Register with live-crew orchestration
orchestrator.register_crew("commentary", commentary_crew,
                          triggers=["goal_scored", "penalty_awarded"],
                          dependencies=[("vision_analysis", -1)],
                          timeout_ms=100)
```

**Week 2-3 Success Criteria**:
- Multiple standard CrewAI crews executing concurrently through both YAML config and Python API
- Dependency resolution working between CrewAI crews regardless of definition approach
- Shared context accessible and modifiable from CrewAI crews (both YAML-based and Python-defined)

- [ ] **Developer Tooling**: YAML validation, crew scaffolding commands, Python API documentation
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete guide for CrewAI developers using live-crew (both approaches)
- [ ] **Migration Path**: Tools to convert existing decorator handlers to both YAML and Python CrewAI patterns

**Performance Targets** (CrewAI integration focus):
- CrewAI crew execution: <500ms per slice including crew loading
- Memory efficiency: Standard CrewAI crews with minimal overhead
- Startup time: <2s to load and initialize multiple CrewAI crews
- Context sync: Efficient context sharing between CrewAI crews

**Week 4 Success Criteria**:
- YAML-driven Hello World <10 lines Python code achieved
- Full CrewAI integration tests passing (100+ new tests expected)
- Standard CrewAI crews run unchanged within live-crew
- Complete documentation for CrewAI developers

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### **Dual CrewAI Integration Approaches** (supporting both YAML and Python patterns)

**Approach 1: YAML-Driven CrewAI Integration**
```python
# Target: <10 lines total Python glue code for multi-crew orchestration
from live_crew import CrewOrchestrator

# Standard CrewAI crews remain completely unchanged
# crews/user_management/ contains: agents.yaml, tasks.yaml, crew.yaml
# crews/analytics/ contains: agents.yaml, tasks.yaml, crew.yaml

orchestrator = CrewOrchestrator.from_config("live_crew_config.yaml")
await orchestrator.run("events.json")
# That's it! Everything else is YAML configuration
```

**Approach 2: Python-Defined CrewAI Integration**
```python
# Target: <10 lines total Python code for multi-crew orchestration
from live_crew import CrewOrchestrator
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Standard CrewAI Python definitions
orchestrator = CrewOrchestrator()
user_crew = Crew(agents=[user_agent], tasks=[user_task])
analytics_crew = Crew(agents=[analytics_agent], tasks=[analytics_task])

orchestrator.register_crew("user_management", user_crew, triggers=["user_signup"])
orchestrator.register_crew("analytics", analytics_crew, triggers=["user_signup"],
                          dependencies=[("user_management", -1)])
await orchestrator.run("events.json")
```

#### **YAML Configuration Structure** (follows spec exactly)
```yaml
# live_crew_config.yaml - Master orchestration configuration
crews:
  - path: "crews/user_management"
    runtime: "user_management.runtime.yaml"
  - path: "crews/analytics"
    runtime: "analytics.runtime.yaml"

# user_management.runtime.yaml - live-crew orchestration for standard CrewAI crew
crew: "user_management"
triggers: ["user_signup", "user_login"]
wait_policy: none
timeout_ms: 100

# analytics.runtime.yaml - Dependency on other crew
crew: "analytics"
triggers: ["user_signup"]
needs:
  - type: crew
    crew: "user_management"
    offset: -1
wait_policy: all
timeout_ms: 200
```

#### **CrewAI Context Integration** (thin wrapper approach)
```python
# Within standard CrewAI crews, context is seamlessly available
# crews/analytics/tasks.yaml (standard CrewAI with live-crew context)
analytics_task:
  description: "Analyze user signup patterns using live-crew shared context"
  expected_output: "User analytics report"
  # live-crew automatically injects context as crew memory
  # No CrewAI modifications required

# Context access in standard CrewAI crew code (zero changes required):
def analyze_user_data(self, context):
    user_count = context.get("user_count", 0)  # Standard Python dict access
    return f"Analyzed {user_count} users"
```

#### **Event-to-CrewAI Mapping** (automatic via YAML)
```yaml
# Automatic event routing to CrewAI tasks based on triggers
triggers: ["user_signup"]
# When "user_signup" event received:
# 1. live-crew loads the standard CrewAI crew
# 2. Injects event data as crew task input
# 3. Provides shared context as crew memory
# 4. Executes standard CrewAI workflow
# 5. Converts CrewAI output to live-crew Actions
```

#### **Enhanced Error Handling** (Multi-crew context-rich errors)
```python
# Context-rich error reporting for distributed failures
class MultiCrewError(Exception):
    """Enhanced error with distributed context and recovery guidance."""
    def __init__(self, crew: str, slice_idx: int, context: dict[str, Any],
                 recovery_suggestions: list[str]):
        self.crew = crew
        self.slice_idx = slice_idx
        self.context = context
        self.recovery_suggestions = recovery_suggestions

# Example error output:
"""
MultiCrewError: Crew 'analytics' failed in slice 42

Error: NATS connection timeout after 5000ms
Crew: analytics
Slice: 42 (timestamp: 2025-08-05T10:21:00Z)
Dependencies: user_management ‚úÖ completed, email_service ‚è≥ pending

Recovery suggestions:
1. Check NATS server connectivity: nats server check
2. Verify crew dependencies properly configured
3. Consider increasing timeout_ms in crew configuration
4. View context at failure: orchestrator.get_error_details('analytics', 42)

Context at failure:
{
  "users": {"user123": {"status": "active"}},
  "slice_timing": {"start": "10:20:59.500Z", "elapsed_ms": 245}
}
"""
```

        .with_command(["-js", "-DV"]) \
        .with_exposed_ports(4222, 8222) as container:
        await wait_for_nats_ready(container.get_exposed_port(4222))
        yield container

# Integration test categories
class TestMultiCrewIntegration:
    async def test_two_crews_sequential_dependency(self):
        """Test crew A completes before crew B starts."""

    async def test_three_crews_diamond_dependency(self):
        """Test complex dependency: A ‚Üí B,C ‚Üí D coordination."""

1. **CVE-2025-30215**: NATS JetStream authorization bypass - **MUST upgrade to NATS 2.11.1+**
2. **Missing Authentication**: NATS connections lack mutual TLS authentication
3. **Context Access Control**: No crew isolation for shared context access

#### **High (CVSS 7.9-7.0)**
4. **Network Validation Gap**: Missing input validation for network-based events
5. **Resource Exhaustion**: No DoS protection for event flooding

#### **Medium (CVSS 6.9-4.0)**
6. **Audit Logging Gap**: No security event logging for compliance
7. **Error Information Disclosure**: Stack traces may leak internal structure

**Security Implementation Plan**:
- **Week 1 Critical**: NATS upgrade, TLS mutual auth, basic crew isolation
- **Week 2-3**: Input validation, resource limits, audit logging framework
- **Week 4**: Security review and penetration testing validation

### üìà Risk Management & Mitigation

#### **High Risk Items**
1. **Context Race Conditions**
   - *Risk*: Concurrent context updates causing data corruption
   - *Mitigation*: JetStream KV optimistic locking, well-defined merge strategies
   - *Testing*: Chaos scenarios with concurrent context updates

2. **Developer UX Degradation**
   - *Risk*: Multi-crew complexity destroys Sprint 2's excellent UX
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure pattern, 100% backward compatibility
   - *Validation*: Continuous UX testing with <25 line Hello World target

3. **Security Implementation Gaps**
   - *Risk*: 7 critical vulnerabilities delay Sprint 3 launch
   - *Mitigation*: Week 1 security sprint, expert security review
   - *Timeline*: Must complete before distributed features

#### **Medium Risk Items**
4. **NATS Connection Leaks**
   - *Risk*: Connection exhaustion under load
   - *Mitigation*: Connection pooling with lifecycle management
   - *Monitoring*: Connection metrics and circuit breaker patterns

5. **Performance Regression**
   - *Risk*: Multi-crew overhead violates 500ms slice timing
   - *Mitigation*: Batch processing, performance benchmarking
   - *Testing*: Load tests with 1000 events/sec validation

### üèÜ Sprint 3 Definition of Done

**CrewAI Integration Completeness**:
- [ ] Both YAML-based CrewAI crews (agents.yaml, tasks.yaml, crew.yaml) and Python-defined CrewAI crews load and execute within live-crew
- [ ] 2-3 CrewAI crews (mixed YAML and Python approaches) running concurrently with dependency coordination
- [ ] Zero modifications required to standard CrewAI crew files (for both approaches)
- [ ] CrewAI output automatically converts to live-crew Actions (universal converter)
- [ ] Shared context seamlessly available within CrewAI crews (both YAML-based and Python-defined)

**Dual-Approach Developer Experience**:
- [ ] Multi-crew Hello World examples ‚â§10 lines code for both YAML and Python approaches
- [ ] Both YAML configuration and Python API patterns fully implemented
- [ ] Both `<crew>.runtime.yaml` pattern and Python `register_crew()` API working
- [ ] Standard CrewAI development workflow preserved for both approaches
- [ ] Zero live-crew framework lock-in (CrewAI crews remain portable regardless of approach)

**Technical Foundation**:
- [ ] CrewAI integration adapter supporting both YAML-based and Python-defined crews
- [ ] Event-to-CrewAI task mapping via both YAML triggers and Python API
- [ ] Context bridge enabling shared state across CrewAI crews (both approaches)
- [ ] 150+ tests passing including comprehensive CrewAI integration tests for both patterns
- [ ] Performance targets met (<500ms slice execution including CrewAI crew loading for both approaches)

### üöÄ Sprint 3 Success Vision

**End State**: Comprehensive CrewAI integration supporting both YAML-driven and Python-defined approaches, enabling teams to choose the right tool for their use case while maintaining perfect CrewAI compatibility.

**Developer Experience**: CrewAI developers can use either approach seamlessly:
- **YAML Approach**: Take existing standard CrewAI crews (agents.yaml, tasks.yaml, crew.yaml), add simple `<crew>.runtime.yaml` orchestration configs, and orchestrate multiple crews with <10 lines of Python
- **Python Approach**: Define CrewAI crews programmatically and register them with live-crew's orchestration API, gaining full programmatic control with <10 lines of integration code

**Architecture**: Clean separation between CrewAI crew logic (unchanged) and live-crew orchestration (configurable via YAML or Python API), enabling the thin wrapper approach with multiple integration patterns.

**CrewAI Integration**: Perfect integration that preserves all standard CrewAI development patterns while adding live-crew's time-slicing, dependency coordination, and shared context capabilities through either configuration approach.

## Notes

- Each milestone maps to the roadmap defined in `references/live_crew_spec.md`
- Tasks should be broken down into specific, actionable items during sprint planning
- Progress should be updated regularly to maintain visibility

## Technical Compatibility Action Items

### Python Version Downgrade - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Tech Lead Decision**: Downgrade from Python 3.13 to Python 3.10 **NOW** (immediately after Sprint 2 completion, before starting Slice 2 work).

**Rationale**:
- Clean break point with Sprint 2 completion
- Zero CrewAI integration code to impact yet
- 169 passing tests provide regression safety net
- Avoids technical debt and mid-development disruption during Slice 2

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Research Phase**: Create comprehensive CrewAI compatibility documentation in `.vibes/references/crewai.md`
2. **Update Spec**: Modify `.vibes/live_crew_spec.md` to reflect Python version constraints
3. **Version Change**: Update `pyproject.toml` to `requires-python = ">=3.10,<3.14"`
4. **Testing**: Recreate virtual environment and run full test suite
5. **Documentation**: Update README and development setup instructions

**Risk Assessment**: Low risk - modern but conservative code patterns, protocol-based architecture should be version-agnostic.
