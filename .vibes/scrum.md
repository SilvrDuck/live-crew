# Live-Crew Development Scrum Board

Progress tracking for implementing the live-crew orchestration service.

## üéØ VERTICAL SLICES - User Value Focused Development

**Strategic Pivot**: Restructured from 13 horizontal milestones to 3 vertical slices based on expert agent recommendations. Each slice delivers complete end-to-end user value rather than building disconnected layers.

### Slice 1: "Hello World" Event Processing üöÄ

**Target Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **User Value**: "I can send an event and see it processed into an action"

**Core Flow**: `File Input ‚Üí Memory Scheduler ‚Üí Console Output`

#### Essential Components

- [ ] **Interface Layer**: Transport, Context, Scheduler protocols (architecture-first approach)
- [ ] **CrewDefinition & Registry**: Basic crew model and registration system
- [ ] **Memory Scheduler**: Single-threaded, in-memory event processing with time slicing
- [ ] **File Event Transport**: Read events from JSON file or stdin
- [ ] **Console Action Transport**: Print actions to console/file output
- [ ] **Dict Context Backend**: Simple in-memory context (no diff-merge yet)
- [ ] **Single Crew Support**: One hardcoded crew for proof-of-concept
- [ ] **Integration Demo**: Working end-to-end example with current Event/Action models

**Foundation Ready**: ‚úÖ Event/Action models, time slicing, config, dependencies (85% complete per architecture review)

#### Success Criteria

```python
# This working example defines "done" for Slice 1:
events = load_events_from_file("events.json")
scheduler = MemoryScheduler(slice_ms=500)
crew = SimpleCrew("hello_world")

for event in events:
    actions = scheduler.process(event, crew)
    for action in actions:
        print(f"Action: {action.kind} - {action.payload}")
```

### Slice 2: "Multi-Crew Orchestration" ‚ö°

**Target Duration**: 3-4 weeks | **User Value**: "I can run multiple crews with dependencies and shared context"

**Core Flow**: `NATS Events ‚Üí Dependency Resolution ‚Üí Multi-Crew ‚Üí NATS Actions`

#### Essential Components

- [ ] **NATS Transport**: Real event/action streams using JetStream
- [ ] **Distributed Scheduler**: NATS-based scheduling with time slice coordination
- [ ] **Context Diff-Merge**: JetStream KV backend with last-writer-wins merge logic
- [ ] **Dependency Resolution**: CrewDep/EventDep orchestration with offset calculations
- [ ] **Multi-Crew Support**: 2-3 crews with dependency chains
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Basic error sink and crew isolation
- [ ] **Context Proxy**: Shared state management between crews

#### UX Enhancements (Slice 2)

- [ ] **Enhanced YAML Configuration**: Comprehensive schema with crew definitions

  - Crew dependency declarations in config
  - Transport/backend selection via configuration
  - Multi-crew orchestration setup via YAML
- [ ] **Orchestrator Multi-Crew API**: `Orchestrator.with_crews()` patterns
- [ ] **Configuration-Driven Crew Registration**: Auto-register crews from config files

**Interface Reuse**: Same Transport/Context/Scheduler interfaces, different implementations

---

### Slice 3: "Production-Ready Platform" üè≠

**Target Duration**: 4-5 weeks | **User Value**: "I can deploy this in production with monitoring and reliability"

**Core Flow**: Full platform with operational features

#### Essential Components

- [ ] **Process Isolation**: Sub-process runners with crew sandboxing
- [ ] **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus metrics + structured JSON logging
- [ ] **Reliability Features**: Heartbeat system + deterministic replay capabilities
- [ ] **Operations Tooling**: CLI commands + Docker Compose deployment
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Vector search integration and performance tuning
- [ ] **Security Hardening**: Input validation, context limits, ACL implementation

#### UX Enhancements (Slice 3)

- [ ] **Production CLI Commands**: Orchestrator-based operational commands

  - `live-crew deploy --config production.yaml`
  - `live-crew monitor --orchestrator-id prod-1`
  - `live-crew replay --from-timestamp 2025-08-01T10:00:00Z`
- [ ] **Docker Integration**: Simplified container deployment with orchestrator patterns
- [ ] **Configuration Templates**: Production-ready YAML templates with best practices
- [ ] **Operational UX**: Simple health checks, status dashboards through orchestrator API

**Architectural Approach**: Monitoring/reliability as decorators around existing interfaces

---

## üì¶ DEFERRED FEATURES (Post-MVP)

These become **optional enhancements** after core vertical slices:

- **Alternative Context Backends** (Redis/memory switching)
- **Multiple Vector Store Adapters** (Milvus, Pinecone beyond Qdrant)
- **Advanced Security Features** (beyond basic hardening)
- **Vector Clip Finder** (specialized search adapter)

## üìã ARCHIVED: Original Horizontal Milestones

<details>
<summary>Click to view original 13-milestone roadmap (for reference)</summary>

**Note**: These milestones are preserved for reference but replaced by vertical slice approach for better user value delivery.

**Original Milestone Progress**:

- Milestone 1: 2/5 complete (Event/Action models, TimeSlice utilities)
- Milestone 2: 1/5 complete (Dependency resolution system)
- Milestones 3-13: Various infrastructure and advanced features

**Key Insight**: Horizontal approach would delay user value until late in development. Vertical slices deliver working software every 2-4 weeks.

#### Sprint 2 UX Polish Phase üé® [NEW - Critical for Launch]

**Target**: Transform 59-line Hello World into 15-line developer-friendly API

**UX Issues Identified by Framework Designer:**

- **Import Hell**: Deep nested imports requiring framework internals knowledge
- **Manual Component Assembly**: Users must wire 5+ components manually
- **Verbose Handler Creation**: Too much boilerplate for simple handlers
- **Missing High-Level API**: No unified entry point for common use cases

**Phase 1: Core UX Improvements (Week 1)** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- [x] **Orchestrator API**: Create unified facade over protocol-based architecture

  - ‚úÖ Facade pattern preserves existing protocols while providing simple defaults
  - ‚úÖ `Orchestrator.from_file()`, `Orchestrator.from_config()` entry points
  - ‚úÖ Sensible defaults: FileEventTransport + ConsoleActionTransport + DictContextBackend
- [x] **Import Simplification**: Clean top-level exports in `__init__.py`

  - ‚úÖ `from live_crew import Orchestrator, event_handler, Event, Action`
  - ‚úÖ Hide internal module structure (`live_crew.backends.context`, etc.)
- [x] **Decorator Patterns**: Simple handler registration

  - ‚úÖ `@event_handler` decorator for minimal boilerplate
  - ‚úÖ Auto-registration with orchestrator instance
- [x] **Hello World Transformation**: Reduce from 59 lines to ~15 lines

  - ‚úÖ Created `minimal_example.py` with 18 lines (under 20-line target)
- [x] **Strategy Pattern Refactor**: Eliminate architectural code smells

  - ‚úÖ Replaced hasattr() duck typing with proper ResultCollector protocol
  - ‚úÖ Clean interface contracts for result collection strategies
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive Orchestrator API validation

  - ‚úÖ 11 integration tests covering basic usage, advanced features, simplified API, error handling

**Phase 2: Configuration Enhancement (Week 2)**

- [ ] **Builder Pattern**: Configuration-driven component assembly

  - `OrchestratorBuilder` for advanced customization scenarios
  - Maintain protocol injection points for advanced users
- [ ] **YAML Configuration**: Enhanced schema for orchestrator setup

  - Crew definitions in config vs code
  - Input/output/backend configuration options
- [ ] **Helper Methods**: Common Action creation patterns

  - `Action.from_event()`, `Action.create()` convenience methods

**Architectural Validation (Architect Review):**

- ‚úÖ **Protocol Integrity**: Facade pattern preserves clean protocol-based architecture
- ‚úÖ **Extensibility**: Advanced users retain full protocol access for customization
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Existing 88 tests validate protocol behavior, facade adds minimal risk
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Facade pattern adds negligible overhead over direct protocol usage

**Success Criteria - UX Transformation:**

```python
# BEFORE: 59-line Hello World (current examples/hello_world/run_example.py)
event_transport = FileEventTransport(events_file)
action_transport = ConsoleActionTransport()
context_backend = DictContextBackend()
crew_registry = SimpleCrewRegistry()
scheduler = MemoryScheduler(config, event_transport, action_transport, context_backend, crew_registry)
# ... 50+ more lines

# AFTER: 15-line Hello World (target)
from live_crew import Orchestrator, event_handler

@event_handler("user_signup")
def greet_user(event):
    return {"kind": "greeting", "payload": f"Welcome {event.payload['name']}!"}

orchestrator = Orchestrator.from_file("events.json")
orchestrator.register_handler(greet_user)
await orchestrator.run()
```

**Final Success Criteria - Phase 1:** ‚úÖ **ALL ACHIEVED**

- ‚úÖ Working end-to-end processing (ACHIEVED)
- ‚úÖ Hello World reduced to <20 lines (ACHIEVED - 18 lines)
- ‚úÖ Single import for common usage (ACHIEVED - `from live_crew import Orchestrator, event_handler`)
- ‚úÖ Protocol-based architecture preserved (ACHIEVED - facade pattern maintains extensibility)
- ‚úÖ Architectural code smells eliminated (ACHIEVED - Strategy pattern replaces duck typing)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage (ACHIEVED - 11 integration tests, 137 core tests passing)

## Notes

- Each milestone maps to the roadmap defined in `references/live_crew_spec.md`
- Tasks should be broken down into specific, actionable items during sprint planning
- Progress should be updated regularly to maintain visibility

## Technical Compatibility Action Items

### Python Version Downgrade - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Tech Lead Decision**: Downgrade from Python 3.13 to Python 3.10 **NOW** (immediately after Sprint 2 completion, before starting Slice 2 work).

**Rationale**:
- Clean break point with Sprint 2 completion
- Zero CrewAI integration code to impact yet
- 169 passing tests provide regression safety net
- Avoids technical debt and mid-development disruption during Slice 2

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Research Phase**: Create comprehensive CrewAI compatibility documentation in `.vibes/references/crewai.md`
2. **Update Spec**: Modify `.vibes/live_crew_spec.md` to reflect Python version constraints
3. **Version Change**: Update `pyproject.toml` to `requires-python = ">=3.10,<3.14"`
4. **Testing**: Recreate virtual environment and run full test suite
5. **Documentation**: Update README and development setup instructions

**Risk Assessment**: Low risk - modern but conservative code patterns, protocol-based architecture should be version-agnostic.
