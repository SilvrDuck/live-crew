# .vibes/references - Local Documentation

## What is this folder?

The `.vibes/references/` folder contains **local documentation files maintained by Claude Code** to provide consistent, up-to-date information about external libraries and tools used in this project.

## Purpose

These reference files serve as Claude's **persistent knowledge base** for:

- **Library Best Practices**: Current patterns and recommended usage for external dependencies
- **API References**: Quick reference for commonly used library features
- **Version-Specific Notes**: Important compatibility information and recent changes
- **Code Examples**: Working patterns and snippets for library integration
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions discovered during development

## Why Local Documentation?

Rather than relying on potentially outdated online documentation or fragmented knowledge across team members, these files ensure:

1. **Consistency**: All developers (human and AI) use the same patterns
2. **Currency**: Information is updated as libraries evolve and project needs change
3. **Project-Specific**: Tailored to our specific use cases and architectural decisions
4. **Accessibility**: Available offline and version-controlled with the project

## File Naming Convention

Files are named after the library or tool they document (e.g., `pydantic.md`, `typer.md`, `pytest.md`).

## Maintenance

These files are **automatically maintained by Claude Code** during development:

- **Research-Driven**: Created when Claude researches current best practices online
- **Experience-Based**: Updated based on actual usage patterns in the project
- **Error-Informed**: Enhanced when troubleshooting library-specific issues
- **Version-Aware**: Updated when dependencies are upgraded

## For Human Developers

While these files are primarily for Claude's reference, they're also valuable for human developers:

- **Onboarding**: Quick way to understand project-specific library usage patterns
- **Reference**: Handy examples and patterns for common tasks
- **Context**: Understanding why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives

## Contributing

Human developers can contribute to these files by:

- Adding notes about discovered patterns or issues
- Updating version-specific information when upgrading dependencies
- Correcting any outdated information found during development
- Adding project-specific examples or use cases

The goal is to maintain a living knowledge base that evolves with the project and its dependencies.
